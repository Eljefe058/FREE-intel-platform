# F.R.E.E. – Freedom of Research, Evidence & Exposure

> An open-source public intelligence platform to expose global corruption, financial influence, and hidden networks of power.

**F.R.E.E.** is an anonymous, decentralized OSINT platform inspired by tools like Palantir — but built for the people. It gathers and fuses public data, analyzes connections, and visualizes political, financial, and corporate relationships using AI and graph databases.

- Expose corruption and conflicts of interest
- Track people, companies, and funding flows
